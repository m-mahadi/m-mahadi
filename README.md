# Moniruzzaman Mahadi
### Founder | AI Research Engineer Building Intelligent Systems from First Principles

I don't just use AI tools—I build them from the ground up. Based in Dhaka, studying at North South University while shipping production systems and deconstructing the mathematical foundations that make LLMs work.

## The 365-Day Deep Dive (Started Dec 27, 2025)
Currently executing a year-long research sprint into frontier AI. Not watching tutorials—implementing papers from scratch, writing backpropagation in pure NumPy, and understanding every matrix multiplication that makes a Transformer tick.

**Core Focus:**
- Transformer architectures and scaling laws
- RAG systems and LLM orchestration for production
- Interpretability and model internals

**Daily Progress:**

## What I'm Building

**Current Projects:**
Building vertical-specific AI systems that solve real problems in underserved domains—where accuracy isn't negotiable and off-the-shelf solutions don't cut it.

**The Long Game:**
- Domain-specific LLMs with surgical precision
- Agentic workflows that handle complex, multi-step reasoning
- Bootstrapped products that fund deeper research

**The Hard Mode Approach:**
I prioritize understanding over convenience. That means implementing algorithms from scratch before using frameworks, writing the calculus before abstracting it away, and knowing exactly what happens when you call `.backward()`.

## The Methodology

**4+3 Execution (Non-Negotiable):**
- 4 hours: Deep theory—papers, mathematical foundations, scratch implementations
- 3 hours: Technical research and production code

**Operating Hours:** 11:30 PM – 6:30 AM
These are my Magic Hours—when the world is quiet, distractions disappear, and I can actually think. 

**Philosophy:**
Depth over breadth. First principles over frameworks. Understanding the "why" behind every partial derivative.
